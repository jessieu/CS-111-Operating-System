1. Introduction
	- lab4b.c: source code for an embedded application that builds and runs (with no errors or warnings) on an embedded system
    - Makefile: build and test.
        default -  build the program.
        check - execute an automated smoke-test of the application to see if it runs and can talk to the sensors.
        clean - delete all programs and output generated by the Makefile
        dist - create the deliverable tarball
    - test.sh: smoke-test     
    - README

2. Challenges
	1. Install mraa library in beaglebone
	2. The pin number and connector mismatched
	3. Order the code so that report is output in cretain period and during waiting for the output, allow sending modification.
