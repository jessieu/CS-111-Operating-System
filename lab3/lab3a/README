1. Introduction
   The tarball contains the following:
   - lab3a.c: Read a file system image and analyzes it.
   - Makefile: build and tun the deliverable program
   - ext2_fs.h: header file that defines the format of the EXT2 file system
   - README: report 

2. Challenges
   There are some problems I have during working on this assignment:
   1. How to check whether a block is in use or not in a bitmap. 
      After looking through TA's slide carefully, I understand how the sample code works, which checks whether the bit is set or not in bitmap entries.
   2. How to calculate the logical block number.
   	  In the i_block for each inode, I consider the structure from bottom to top. At the very bottom, all of the entries are data blocks, first 12 blocks belongs to first 12 i_block entries, which are direct blocks pointer. The following 12 - block/4 entries belong to single indirect block. Each single inidrect block has block/4 entries, and each double indirect block has block/4 single indirect block, so on and so forth.
